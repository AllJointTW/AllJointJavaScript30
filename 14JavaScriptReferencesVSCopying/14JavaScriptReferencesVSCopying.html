    let number2 = number

    number2 = 200

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players

    console.log(players, team)

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // team[3] = 'fuck'
    // console.log(players, team)

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice()

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]

    team4[3] = 'murmur'
    console.log(players, team4)

    const team5 = Array.from(players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      hame: 'tom',
      age: 69
    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    // const captaion = person
    
    // captaion.age = 96

    // console.log(person, captaion)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 96, age: 12 })
    console.log(person, cap2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person}

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
